# Solutions To Common Interview Questions

This is a Project where I solve common interview questions,
as well as practice what I have learned through out my time at Revature.

## Running this application

* If you made a clone of this repository, (assuming you are able to run and modify
Maven projects) all you would need to do is run the Application class.
* If you wanted to change the values of the inputs, you would want to go to the 
ApplicationHelper class where there is a description of how to change the inputs.

## Current State of the Project

Currently this is a minimum viable product. I have written the solutions to 
some common questions and they have been tested

### Current solutions

* Factorial (recursively and iteratively)
* Fibonacci (recursively and iteratively)
* FizzBuzz
* Palindrome (checks if a string is a palindrome)
* Reverse a string only using String.charAt()
* A method that swaps two characters in a string and adds a space
	* Ex: input: "String" => output: "tS ir gn"

## Future of the Project

* I would like to add an Angular application so that inputs to the solutions could 
be sent to the methods and returned to the Angular app via HTTP.
* Once there is an Angular app, I would like develop a pipeline so that any person
would be able to access my solutions to these methods.
