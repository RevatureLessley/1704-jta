5 Sublanguages of SQL
	DML
		manipulation 
		UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE 
	DDL
		definition
		CREATE, DROP, TRUNCATE, ALTER, RENAME 
	DQL
		query 
		SELECT
	DCL
		control
		GRANT, REVOKE
	TCL
		transaction 
		COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT 
	
What are the different constraints
	PK - Primary key 
		unique and not null 
		used to uniquely identify each record within a table 
		can only have one per table, but can be composed of multiple columns 
	FK - Foriegn key 
		unique 
		used to establish a relationship with a primary or unique key from another table 
	UK - Unique Key 
		unique and can be null 
		ensures values in the column are unique 
	NNK - Not Null Key 
		requires values in a column are not null 
	CK - Check Key 
		ensures values in a column meets certain validation criteria 
	DK - Default Key 
		specifies a default value for a column if one is not provided 

What is cascade delete
	a foreign key with a record pointing to a parent table will delete the record in the child's table 
	
What are some common commands/clauses and their syntax (I gave you a cheat sheet)


What are the different relationships? (Multiplicity)
	one to one 
		pk to uk
	one to many 
		pk to fk 
	many to many 
		junction table 

How do you enforce the different relationships
	referential integrity (?)
		principle that every row in a referring table must point to a value row in the referred table 

What is an ERD
	data modelling technique which represents the relationship between entities as well as the entity framework
		entities 
		attributes 
		relationships 

What is Normalization
	process of reducing redundant data in an entity 
	ensuring all tables are granular in nature 

How do you enforce Normalization
	depends on the form:
		1NF
			create a table for each set of related data identified by a PK 
		2NF 
			all non-key contraints depend on the PK 
		3NF
			all non-key column are not transitively dependent on the PK 

What is Denormalization
	adds redundant data to a table 

What is OLAP/OLTP
	OLTP - Online Transaction Processing 
		updates to the DB are instant 
		normalized to 3NF 
		data updates are kept as short as possible 
	OLAP - Online Analytical Processing 
		static data, infrequent updates 
		no normalization 
		"data warehouse"
		
What is a nested query
	quering a query 

What is referential integrity
	principle that foriegn keys in any referencing table must always refer to a valid row in the referred table 

What is an orphaned record
	record that references a key which no longer exists
	if referential integrity is enforced with a FK, this can never happen 

What is an aggregate function/scalar function
	aggregate:
		function that returns single output from an array of input 
		AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM, etc
	scalar: 
		single output form single input 
		returns one output from one input 

What is a join
	allows retrival of data from two or more tables, based on a logical relationship 

What are the different joins available
	INNER: returns the rows on the left table that match the rows in the right table, based on the join predicate 
	OUTER: returns all the rows that match based on the join predicate, as well as all that don't 
	LEFT: returns all the rows from the left table, as well as those from the right, that match the predicate 
	RIGHT: returns all the rows from the right table, as well as those on right, that match the predicate 
	self: a table is joined with itself
	CROSS: Cartesian product between 2 tables, every row in one table is joined to all rows in another 
	NATURAL: join on all columns with the same name 
	theta: join in which any relational operator is used in the join predicate 

What are the difference between the joins 
	see above 
	
What is a Set Operation
	allows results of multiple queries to be combined into a single result 

What are the different Set Operations available
	UNION 
	UNION ALL 
	INTERSECT 
	MINUS(EXCEPT)

What are the differences between the set operations
	see above 
	
What is the purpose of LIKE
	in a where clause, to search for a pattern (such as in a string)
	
What is the purpose of DISTINCT
	after SELECT, to return only different values 

What is the purpose of SELECT INTO
	copies data from one table into another 
	
What is the difference between Set Operations and Joins
	joins combines data into new columns, 
	sets combine rows into existing columns 

What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING
	WHERE specifies a search condition within a group to be displayed 
		check conditions before aggregation takes place 
	HAVING specifices a search condition for a group or aggregate funcition in a SELECT 
		check conditions after aggregation takes place 

What is the difference between DELETE, DROP, and TRUNCATE
	DELETE
		removes records that match the WHERE clause (all in a table if none is provided)
	DROP
		completely removes table from the DB, including rows, procedures, and constraints 
	TRUNCATE 
		removes all records from a table (cannot be rolled back )
		
What is the difference between ORDER BY and GROUP BY
	sorts the result set by one or more columns 

What is PL/SQL
	procedural language extension of sql 
	allows for additional functionality, such as sort, UDF's, cursors, and triggers 

What is a Stored Procedure
	PL/SQL block which performs one or more specific tasks 

What is a UDF
	User Defined Function, similiar to a procedure, except that it must return a value 

What are the differences between a SP and a UDF
	Stored Procedure 
		compiled once, executes when called			
		return 0...N values 						
		cannot be used in SELECT, WHERE, HAVING		
		can have IN,OUT, or INOUT parameters 		
		can use trasnactions 						
	User Defined Function 
		(compiled and executed) everytime they are called 
		must return a value 
		SELECT, WHERE, HAVING can be used 
		can only have IN parameters 
		cannot use stored procedures or transactions 
		
What is a trigger
	stored programs in PL/SQL which are automatically executes 
	SERVERERROR, LOGON, LOGOFF, STARTUP, SHUTDOWN 

What is a cursor
	temporary work area (context area) created in system memory when an SQL statement is executed 
	contains information on a SELECT statement and the rows accessed by it 
	useful for when an application cannot work effectively with the entire resultset 

What is a transaction
	logical atomic unit of work that contains one ore more sql statements 
	all obey ACID 

What are the transaction properties (ACID)
	Atomicity 
		
	Consistency 
		
	Isolation 
		in the process of running, the no other transaction can see it until it is committed
	Durability 
		once a transaction is committed, it is permanant
	
What are the Isolation Levels
	read uncommited 
		lowest level, allows for all of the following 
	read commited 
		keeps write locks on the selected data until the end of a transaction 
		replaced as soon as SELECT is performed 
	repeatable reads 
		requires read and write locks until the end of a transaction 
	serializable 
		requires read and write locks until on selected data to be released at the end of a transaction 
		no concurrency issues 

What are the Concurrency Issues 
	dirty read 
		*wow* reads data written by another transaction but has not yet been commited 
	nonrepeatedable reads 
		transaction rereads data it has previously read and finds that another transaction has modified the data 
	phantom read
		during the course of a transaction, new rows are being added by another transaction to the records being saved 

	Isolation level 		dirty read 			non repeatable reads 		phantom read
																						
	Read Uncommited				✓						✓						✓
																						
	Read Committed 				X						✓						✓
																						
	Repeatable Reads 			X						X						✓
																						
	Serializable 				X						X						X
																						

What is JDBC
	Java DataBase Connectivity 
	API for how a client might access a database 

What are the important interfaces
	Connection 
	Statement 
	Prepared Statement 
	Callable Statement 
	Result Set 
	
How do you connect to the database
	Create a connection object 
	Create a statement object 
	Execute the statement and get a resultset, or number of rows affected 
	Close the resources 

What are the different ways you can execute a statement
	execute (boolean)
	executeQuery (String)
	executeUpdate (int)
	
What is the DAO
	Data Access Object 
	design pattern to abstract and encapsulate all access from the data source
