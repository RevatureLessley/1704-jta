# Project 0 Read Me 
This contains the Maven Project folder with the *entire* project0 data.

## Quick Notes
* Upon feature completion, the project folder was renamed from ProjectZeroAlpha to Project 0. I hope github didn't give the impression the entire thing was uploaded all once! 
* The *.txt resource files, such as user.txt, can be deleted and removed. They are generated upon data entry.
* Implemented JUnit testing. Check it out if you want to test my code! 
* The ErrorLogs come directly from running in the Spring Tool Suite. These are *not* backed up, and treated as disposable.

## How to Use
* Run it! Experiment! It should be straight forward.
* Requires direct input from the console
* Don't be afraid to mistype when prompted for a selection. Common errors should be handled! 

## Feature Wishlist
* Encryption of stored user data after serialization
* Additional balance information, such as overdrawn account warnings 
* Administrator features, such as preventing admins from putting a lock on other admins etc 
* "Back" menu option in some locations 
* Make an object Admin extend from User extend from Person
* Use of singletons in the HashMap, and everything that goes with it 

## Changelog
* Just look at github pushes for now. 
* This bit is only here for future readme creation reference 
	* You can even use indented bullet points like this! 

## Bugs
* Ensuring all temporary files have been deleted at the end of any given test run
* Every now and then, there's an error when logging in. Cannot reproduce!
