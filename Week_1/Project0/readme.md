Project Zero Requirements:
A Console Application that does the following:
-user creation: my program has a creator class which stores the users in an ArrayList
		of my user object
-user login: the users can log in, no password is required, as long as you have the user
	     name you can log into their account. Users can add and deduct balance
-admin: a boolean in the user. Can approve or reject users. Can lock and unlock users.
-all data is serialized so ending the program doesn't eliminate user list.
